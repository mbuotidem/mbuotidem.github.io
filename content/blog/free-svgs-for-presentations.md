**You can get excellent SVG's at [svgrepo](https://www.svgrepo.com/)**

Sometimes, you gotta make a slide deck. And you need icons or vectors to make your presentation come alive. 
This article was going to be about using prompting and chatgpt to get the svg you need and validating and 
downloading it using [svgviewer.dev](https://www.svgviewer.dev/svg-to-png). 

You can of course still absolutely do that. But before you do, check [svgrepo.com](https://www.svgrepo.com/) first. 
Everything you need might be there already, under an MIT License, and with no one showing you premium
content while you just want to find free assets. 

Thank goodness for open source!
