Iâ€™m a software engineer who loves working with cloud applications. In my current role, I am spending a lot of time in the AWS ecosystem building infrastructure as code, improving developer experience/productivity, and helping to promote a devops culture.  In the past, I have worked with C#, the Microsoft stack, and Azure, doing everything from developing web applications to chatbots. I am most comfortable working in Python, C# and JavaScript on both AWS and Azure.

**Philosophy**

I enjoy learning new technology and languages. I've always found that such playful exploration and continuous learning not only keeps my skills sharp but also is genuinely gratifying. 

**Interests**

On weekends, I can be found either showing off my salsa dance moves or making hard tackles on the soccer pitch.
