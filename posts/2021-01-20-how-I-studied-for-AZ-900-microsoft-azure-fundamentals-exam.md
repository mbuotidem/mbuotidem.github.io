I just passed the AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals exam and I wanted to add some quick notes on the resources I used to prepare for it. Before I go on to do that, if you haven't already, check out my post on how to score a [free or discounted Azure certification exam.](https://mbuotidem.github.io/blog/2021/01/17/how-to-get-free-or-discounted-microsoft-azure-certifications.html)

Okay, back to the topic on hand, AZ-900. AZ-900 is a beginner level Azure exam and if you've used the Azure Portal to develop cloud applications, as was my case, passing it really does not require extensive preparation. All I used was the official training available from [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals?source=learn). The learning paths available here come with built-in free labs and links to Microsoft Documentation on the various Azure services discussed. The labs are a pretty nifty feature but not every service is accessible via them. For access to those services, consider signing up for a free Azure account.

If you don't have much experience with the Azure Portal, I would recommend supplementing Microsoft Learn and the Microsoft Docs the various modules refer you to with some sort of course. For all things Microsoft, I lean towards Pluralsight. They do have an [AZ-900 learning path](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/microsoft-azure-fundamentals-az-900) If I had absolutely no Azure knowledge, this would have been my starting point. 

Next up, AZ-204.
