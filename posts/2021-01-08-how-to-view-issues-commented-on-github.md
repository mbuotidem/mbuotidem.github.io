Have you ever wanted to check back on a GitHub issue you made a comment on? I recently needed to and floundered about on the UI trying to find a link or button that would help me do that. Ultimately, I was unsuccessful and had to turn to Google. Here's how to do it courtesy of the the lovely folks at [stackexchange](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/103374/where-can-i-see-all-my-comments-on-issues-on-github).

\
Make sure you're logged in and then enter the url

`https://github.com/notifications/subscriptions?commenter={yourusername}`

\
So in my case, that would be :

`https://github.com/notifications/subscriptions?commenter=mbuotidem`
