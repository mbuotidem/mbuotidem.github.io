**My First Post**


How do you 'cd' or change directory containing a space in the name?

For example, say you are in WSL and you want to navigate to Program Files in your windows installation?

You have a few options: 

You can quote the whole directory name or escape the space in between the words.
In a nutshell, do any one of the following:
cd 'My Programs'
cd "My Programs"
cd My\ Programs
