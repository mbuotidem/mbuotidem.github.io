                    <dt>Background</dt>
                    <dd>I am a driven software engineer with a background in product management and development. I enjoy working on 
                        both the front end and the back end as well as leading teams to ship great products that serve customer's needs.
                        My favorite language is C# and naturally, I'm pretty conversant with the Microsoft stack - .NET Core, Entity Framework, 
                        Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Azure. However, I equally enjoy playing with Python for personal projects.

                    <dd>I enjoy learning new technology and languages. Continuous learning and personal development
                        make working in the software industry exciting and I love adding new skills to my repertoire. I'm looking for a
                        challenging and rewarding position with a progressive, dynamic organization, where product
                        excellence is a focus.</dd>
                    <dt>Personal Interests</dt>
                    <dd>When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time improving my salsa dance skills as well as exploring other latin dance styles. 
                        I'm also an avid soccer fan and player and thus spend my weekends making hard tackles and scoring goals. I'm convinced that
                        in an alternate universe, I am a star forward for a Spanish League team. As you can probably tell, daydreaming is another of my pastimes.
